# KDU FOE repository

## A repository of Past Papers, Lectures Slides, and other Course Materials for the Engineering Degrees carried out at the Faculty of Engineering, Kotelawala Defence University 

This repository was created to store all course materials in a central location, to support undergraduates of the various streams of the faculty of engineering. Contributions are welcome!

The Repository is structured as follows:

Stream → Semester → Module → Papers / Lecture Slides / Other Materials

Papers are titled in the following format:

<b>Intake</b> <i>[Intake Number]</i> - <i>[Module Code]</i> - <i>[Module Title]</i> <b>(Exam Paper)</b>

For example:

Intake 39 - ET 3122 - Antennas and Propagation (Exam Paper)

Lecture Slides may be further divided into subfolders if slides sets from different lecturers are available. 

NOTE: This repository primarily uses the Electronics and Telecommunication Stream modules. Common modules are accessible via other streams subfolders using symlinks, which may not work effectively on some systems.

This repository is based on <a href= "https://github.com/DevinRC">DevinRC</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/DevinRC/iit-past-assessments">IIT repository</a>
